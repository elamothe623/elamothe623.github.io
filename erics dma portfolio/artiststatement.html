            <h1>Step Down</h1>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/235519940" width="400" height="200" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/235519940">found footage final</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user70344716">Eric Lamothe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<h1>Coca Planes</h1>
<p>This video was created as a representation of a sort of stream of conciousness. The videos don't connect to eachother by thin tangents that can be seen but are pretty subtle. THe goal here was to create a pleasing piece that the viewer can kind of loosen up by viewing</p>
<h1>Action Aliens</h1>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/234462220" width="400" height="230" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/234462220">Action aliens 4 final</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user70344716">Eric Lamothe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>This video was meant to convey a humour. We face absurdity on a daily basis but for the most part we think nothing of it because we choose not to. The alien is just representational of that absurdity.</p>
<h1>no camera zone</h1>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/236886159" width="400" height="220" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/236886159">where cameras shouldnt go</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user70344716">Eric Lamothe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p> This was an attempt at experimental camera mounting that will give the viewer a sense of anxiety. Nobody likes to see things coming rapidly at their field of vision and this video kind of plays on that general anxiety. IT's really just meant to make the viewer uncomfortable.</p>

<h>Take IT Back</h>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/236675200" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/236675200">take it back</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user70344716">Eric Lamothe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The stills come from the movie junior which is really such a rediculous movie. I decided to alter the stills to fit the mood that I got from viewing them. The edits are a little jarring but this movie is kind of a fever dream of an idea. The audio samples the most important line of the scene.

<h1>Bed Bugs</h1>

<img class="wp-image-71 aligncenter" src="https://ericdodigitalmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/infestation.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="667" height="400" />
<p>Bed bugs are disgusting little creatures that just shouldn't be around. They make people super uncomfortable and I think this picture does too. The glitch effect on the image is the bed bug image converted into a sound file and edited within a sound program then reconverted into an image.</p>
<h1>Broke</h1>

            <img class="wp-image-86 aligncenter" src="https://ericdodigitalmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/project-1-art-74-broke.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="609" height="407" />
<p>This is a commentary on poverty in America, specifically in the city of San Jose. People who live on the streets here are people who could use lots of help. They should not be resigned to die by lack of money and kindness. Someones death should not be caused by a lack of money.</p>
<h1>Along the fence</h1>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/240408226">along the fence</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user70344716">Eric Lamothe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>This is a flash animation that deals with lost love and the necessity to move past it. We lose people, that's life, we have to keep going forward. This was inspired by a recent loss of someone close to me.</p>


<h1>The Clown is Back</h1>

            <img class="wp-image-80 aligncenter" src="https://ericdodigitalmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/glitch-art.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="695" height="464" />

&nbsp;
<p>This is another glitched image that uses the editing of an image converted to a sound file. The images in question were a picture of a clown, a model's butt, and a sandwich sandwiched in between two sandwiches. The clown shows in the image with prominance witch gives it sort of a horror vibe. Like the feeling that the clown is going to come through the screen.</p> 

<h1>A Man-tis</h1>
        
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/240408225" width="400" height="270" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/240408225">a man tis</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user70344716">Eric Lamothe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>This was made as an animation to test hand drawn transformatiion. The mantis was chosen because it represents one of the most monstrous insects in nature. Mantises are some of the most brutal creatures and there's a lot of subtext to transforming into something like that.</p>

<h1>I'm Tired</h1>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/347386406&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
 <p> This was made as a sound project that captures the depraivity of me at 4:00 am. I was watching alot of horrible things on the internet that got me inspired to do this sound project. All of the sounds are of me recording into a microphone in my bedroom at 4:00 am, with some editing.</p>
